#  **Setting up IAM:**

This week I will be working on Terraform Lab for the class.

Here are some of the items I am looking into before getting started:

- **Installation Process**
- **Deploying a Server**


------------


***Installation Process***

Terraform has to be installed on a custom-controlled machine. Look for the latest version on Terraform [website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html "website")


**Step 1: Installing Zip with command and unzip to download**

    sudo apt-get install zip -y

    unzip terraform*.zip

**Step 2:Test the installation**

    terraform version



------------


***Deploying a Server and initialising Terraform***

    mkdir ~/terraform

    cd ~/terraform

    nano config.tf

Paste the code below into config file
    # main.tf
    provider "kubernetes" {}

Initialize by executing the command

    terraform init

and apply changes

    terraform apply
------------
