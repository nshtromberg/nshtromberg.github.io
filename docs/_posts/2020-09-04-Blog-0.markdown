***Getting Started with GitHub***

GitHub is an excellent way to collaborate with your team while working on a code.
First step is to register you user name and create a password.
Open [GitHub Website](http://www.github.com "GitHub Website") and create a new account. The account is free and allows users to create multiple blogs.
**Repository**is created to keep your projects organized.

GitHub blogs can be maintained and modified directly by editing the code in your

    _post

or by editing the code locally and then pushing it to **Github** with *Jekyll*.
